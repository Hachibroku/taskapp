# Project Alpha

This is a fully-feature task management application that I developed as part of Hack Reactor's 19-week Immersive Software Engineering Bootcamp. It is built with Python, Django, HTML, CSS and SQLite. It meets all requirements and specifications, and passes all of the included tests. I have added my own CSS to the static frontend to imitate a retro design, however this was not a requirement of the project and was done after it's submission.
